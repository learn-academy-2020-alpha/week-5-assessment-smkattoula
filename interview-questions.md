# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own there is always something more to learn.   

1. Rails follows an MVC pattern. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Model, View, Controller.

  Researched answer: Rails has an application directory called app/ with three subdirectories: models, views, and controllers. This is the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which enforces a separation between business logic from the input and presentation logic associated with a graphical user interface (GUI).



2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: a file that contains bundles or packages that can be used in the terminal or interface

  Researched answer: Gems' are software packages, libraries and utilities. Operating systems like Linux and Unix have repositories of software which are installed in a similar way. Since that was such a great idea, the communities around Ruby, Python, Haskell, and others wrote package management tools for their languages.



3. Why is it important to have validations in your application?

  Your answer: To make sure that the code in the application works properly. 

  Researched answer: Data validation is vital to ensure the data is clean, correct and useful. ... On the other hand, if it doesn't ask you, any errors you get in your data are going to flow right through into the data warehouse.



4. Describe a possible relationship between a model called Person and a model called Computer. Based on your description, which model would hold the foreign key?

  Your answer: The Person model would hold the primary key and the Computer model would hold the foriegn key. 

  Researched answer: A primary key-foreign key relationship defines a one-to-many relationship between two tables in a relational database. A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that references the primary key columns in another table.



5. What is object-relational mapping?

  Your answer: Dang, I forgot this one. Is it where you have an object that is assigned to a string, integer, or boolean??

  Researched answer: Object-relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.
- RESTful routes: The client/server relationship is a prerequisite of a set of principles known as REST(representational state transfer) which provides a way of mapping HTTP verbs ( get, post, put, delete) and CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) together.
- json: JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML. Squarespace uses JSON to store and organize site content created with the CMS.
- API: An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.
- Endpoints: Endpoints are remote computing devices that connect to a network and communicates back and forth with the network.
- Strong params: Strong Parameters. It provides an interface for protecting attributes from end-user assignment. This makes Action Controller parameters forbidden to be used in Active Model mass assignment until they have been explicitly enumerated.
